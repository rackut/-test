1
00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.251
Claire.

2
00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:28.850
I miss you.

3
00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:40.255
Dr. Weir report to the Lewis and Clark
in Docking Bay 4.

4
00:05:58.024 --> 00:06:00.400
- Ion drive set.
- Thank you.

5
00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:06.073
Heading: Vector One, nine degrees.

6
00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:14.081
We are prepped for lockdown.

7
00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:20.295
I can't believe it,
this is ridiculous.

8
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.300
I haven't got more than my hand
in the last six weeks, and now this shit.

9
00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.511
I mean, why can't we go
to Mars, Captain?

10
00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:32.015
- I mean, Mars has got women.
- Smith's right.

11
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.767
Neptune, there's nothing out there.

12
00:06:33.851 --> 00:06:36.103
Yeah, and if the shit goes down,
we'll be on our own.

13
00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:37.896
You know the rules, people.

14
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.025
Someone drops the ball,
we get the call. Now, let's go.

15
00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:44.236
- Have you got our course plotted in?
- Yes, sir.

16
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.364
- Locked and cocked and ready to rock.
- Mr. Justin?

17
00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:50.120
Everything's green on my screen,
Skipper.

18
00:06:50.121 --> 00:06:51.060
Start your countdown now.

19
00:06:51.061 --> 00:06:54.496
Ion drive will engage
in T minus 10 minutes.

20
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.289
Thank you, Lieutenant.

21
00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:57.541
Let's go.

22
00:06:57.625 --> 00:07:00.460
- Smith, you follow me.
- Yes, ma'am.

23
00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:03.588
- Justin, get those tanks prepped.
- Yes, sir.

24
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.219
- Mr. Cooper.
- Skipper.

25
00:07:09.303 --> 00:07:12.639
- Ion drive in 10 minutes.
- It's time to play spam-in-the-can.

26
00:07:12.723 --> 00:07:15.308
- Skipper.
- Peters.

27
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.186
Captain Miller, I just wanted
to say this is something...

28
00:07:18.191 --> 00:07:20.397
Clock is ticking, Doctor.

29
00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:24.484
You waiting for a personal invitation,
there, Mr. Smith?

30
00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:26.500
- No, sir.
- Captain, I don't want to take up...

31
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.114
Doctor, if you'll just follow
the rest of the crew to the grav tanks,

32
00:07:29.198 --> 00:07:30.449
we're almost underway.

33
00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:32.451
That bunk better be squared away,
Mr. Cooper,

34
00:07:32.455 --> 00:07:34.244
or you'll find yourself
walking to Neptune.

35
00:07:34.328 --> 00:07:35.620
What's the hold-up, Peters?

36
00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:38.623
Just loading the last of
the CO2 scrubbers, sir.

37
00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:40.667
You stand right here.

38
00:07:43.504 --> 00:07:44.754
Thanks, D.J.

39
00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:46.506
- Hats off in the tank.
- Sir.

40
00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:49.259
- First time in a grav couch?
- Yeah.

41
00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:54.473
I think your captain has some
kind of a problem with me.

42
00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:56.766
Oh, well. Don't worry about him.

43
00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:59.269
He just loves having complete
strangers on his ship.

44
00:07:59.353 --> 00:08:01.229
- D.J.
- Yeah.

45
00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:04.816
No.

46
00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:06.818
Is this necessary?

47
00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:10.822
When the ion drive fires,
you'll be taking about 30 G's.

48
00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:15.160
Without a tank, the force
would liquety your skeleton.

49
00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:19.080
I've seen the effect on mice.

50
00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:24.294
Claustrophobic?

51
00:08:24.837 --> 00:08:26.046
Very.

52
00:08:50.738 --> 00:08:52.155
Billy.

53
00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:37.951
I'm so alone.

54
00:09:40.871 --> 00:09:42.122
Hello?

55
00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:52.966
Is anyone there?

56
00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:03.852
Oh, God.

57
00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:39.012
Billy?

58
00:10:40.556 --> 00:10:42.223
I'm so cold.

59
00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:53.443
Claire.

60
00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:58.031
I'm waiting.

61
00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:13.296
You're all right. Breathe. D.J.!

62
00:11:14.423 --> 00:11:16.341
- Okay, Dr. Weir, let's get you up.
- Okay, I'm fine.

63
00:11:16.425 --> 00:11:17.476
- Come on, take it easy.
- I'm fine.

64
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.428
Okay. There you go.

65
00:11:21.263 --> 00:11:24.683
Now move nice and slow.
You've been in stasis for 56 days.

66
00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:27.477
You're gonna experience
a little disorientation, you understand?

67
00:11:27.561 --> 00:11:31.314
- I'm all right now, thank you.
- Okay, take that. Don't rush it.

68
00:11:31.607 --> 00:11:33.274
All yours.

69
00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:38.780
You okay, Doc?

70
00:11:39.782 --> 00:11:42.450
- Want some coffee?
- What?

71
00:11:43.327 --> 00:11:45.995
Would you like some coffee?

72
00:11:47.164 --> 00:11:49.499
No. Thank you.

73
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.502
All right, suit yourself.

74
00:11:52.628 --> 00:11:54.045
What about you, Starck?

75
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.965
Would you like something
hot and black inside you?

76
00:11:57.508 --> 00:11:59.509
- Is that an offer?
- It is not.

77
00:11:59.635 --> 00:12:02.762
- How about some coffee then?
- Starck?

78
00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:05.056
- Yes, sir.
- Why aren't you on the bridge?

79
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:06.391
Do you mind if I get dressed first?

80
00:12:06.475 --> 00:12:08.927
As a matter of fact, Lieutenant,
I do mind if you get dressed first.

81
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:11.730
Let's go, people.
We have a job to do.

82
00:12:12.189 --> 00:12:15.734
Okay, Denny, here we go.
Happy birthday.

83
00:12:15.818 --> 00:12:18.027
Play horsey, Mommy. Play horsey.

84
00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:20.488
Hey, no more ball in the house.

85
00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:23.491
You're the one who can't catch.

86
00:12:23.617 --> 00:12:27.495
- Yo, apologize.
- Sorry about that, Mama Bear.

87
00:12:27.621 --> 00:12:29.080
- All right.
- All right, then.

88
00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:31.040
- Peters.
- Yes, sir.

89
00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:33.918
I did try to find
a replacement for you,

90
00:12:34.003 --> 00:12:36.755
but with such short notice,
it was impossible.

91
00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:38.214
I am sorry.

92
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.260
I talked to my ex. He's going to
take Denny for Christmas.

93
00:12:42.344 --> 00:12:45.472
I'll get him for the summer, so..

94
00:12:45.556 --> 00:12:47.223
everything's all right.

95
00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:48.850
Smitty.

96
00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:50.900
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen,

97
00:12:50.945 --> 00:12:52.937
in approximately
2 hours and 23 minutes,

98
00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:55.320
we'll be arriving in the
orbit of Neptune.

99
00:12:55.321 --> 00:12:55.921
Thank you very much.

100
00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:58.359
- I thank you.
- That's good.

101
00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:01.279
All boards are green.
Everything's five by five.

102
00:13:01.363 --> 00:13:03.907
- U.S.A.C. Been notified of our position?
- Yes, sir.

103
00:13:03.991 --> 00:13:05.742
- All right, people, listen up.
- D.J.

104
00:13:05.826 --> 00:13:07.911
As you all know,
we have an addition to our crew.

105
00:13:07.995 --> 00:13:10.330
Dr. Weir, you care to join us?

106
00:13:10.998 --> 00:13:14.501
Introductions all around.
This is my XO, Lieutenant Starck.

107
00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:16.252
Mr. Justin, Engineering.

108
00:13:16.378 --> 00:13:18.004
The funky spaceman over here
is Mr. Cooper.

109
00:13:18.088 --> 00:13:20.298
What exactly is it you do
on board this ship, Coop?

110
00:13:20.382 --> 00:13:22.951
Listen up, Doc,
I'm your best friend, okay?

111
00:13:22.977 --> 00:13:25.512
I am the lifesaver and
the heartbreaker.

112
00:13:25.596 --> 00:13:27.430
He's a rescue technician.

113
00:13:27.556 --> 00:13:31.601
This is Peters, medical technician.
And my pilot, Mr. Smith.

114
00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:35.230
The gloomy Gus in the corner
over there, that's...

115
00:13:35.314 --> 00:13:37.649
D.J. Trauma.

116
00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:41.402
All right, all right.

117
00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:44.614
Now we all know each other.
Skipper, I got a question.

118
00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.740
What the fuck
are we doing way out here?

119
00:13:46.742 --> 00:13:50.245
Perhaps the good doctor
will be kind enough to tell us.

120
00:13:50.579 --> 00:13:51.955
Thank you.

121
00:13:52.748 --> 00:13:54.700
First of all, I want to say
how much I appreciate

122
00:13:54.717 --> 00:13:56.350
this opportunity to join you
on what I...

123
00:13:56.351 --> 00:13:58.310
It's for sure that you
appreciate being here, Doctor,

124
00:13:58.311 --> 00:14:00.340
but you must understand
that we don't.

125
00:14:00.756 --> 00:14:02.549
We were taken off
a well-deserved leave

126
00:14:02.633 --> 00:14:04.175
and sent into Neptune space.

127
00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.762
We are now three billion klicks
from the nearest outpost.

128
00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:11.683
The last time U.S.A.C. attempted
a rescue this far past the outer reach,

129
00:14:11.767 --> 00:14:15.019
well, we lost both ships.
So, if you please...

130
00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:17.021
Right. Well...

131
00:14:18.023 --> 00:14:21.818
Everything I'm about to tell you
is considered Code Black by the NSA.

132
00:14:21.944 --> 00:14:24.412
U.S.A.C. Intercepted
a radio transmission

133
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.948
from a decaying orbit
around Neptune.

134
00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:31.619
The source of this transmission
has been identified

135
00:14:31.704 --> 00:14:33.621
as the Event Horizon.

136
00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.042
Yeah, well, that's bullshit,
for starters.

137
00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:41.296
- Skipper, you took me off leave...
- Thank you so much.

138
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.172
Smitty, sit down.

139
00:14:44.675 --> 00:14:47.010
Cooper, as you were.

140
00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:49.387
Let the man speak.

141
00:14:49.471 --> 00:14:51.470
What was made public
about the Event Horizon,

142
00:14:51.473 --> 00:14:53.892
that she was a deep space
research vessel,

143
00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:58.062
that her reactor went critical,
and that the ship blew up,

144
00:14:58.147 --> 00:14:59.731
none of that is true.

145
00:14:59.815 --> 00:15:03.234
The Event Horizon was the culmination
of a secret government project

146
00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:06.821
to create a spacecraft
capable of faster-than-light flight.

147
00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:10.100
I don't... Excuse me.
See, you can't actually do that.

148
00:15:10.105 --> 00:15:13.828
The law of relativity
prohibits faster-than-light travel.

149
00:15:14.496 --> 00:15:18.082
Relativity, yes. We can't break
the law of relativity.

150
00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:20.501
We can go around it.

151
00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:22.587
The ship doesn't really
go faster than light.

152
00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:25.073
What it does is it creates
a dimensional gateway

153
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.920
that allows it to jump
instantaneously

154
00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:30.345
from one point of the universe
to another light years away.

155
00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:31.679
How?

156
00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:35.892
- Well, it's difficult to... It's all math.
- Try us, Doctor.

157
00:15:37.353 --> 00:15:39.896
Right, well, using layman's terms,

158
00:15:40.397 --> 00:15:42.607
we use a rotating magnetic field

159
00:15:42.611 --> 00:15:46.945
to focus a narrow beam of gravitons.
These in turn fold space-time,

160
00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:49.113
consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics,

161
00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:51.950
until the space-time curvature
becomes infinitely large

162
00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.535
and you produce a singularity.
Now, the singularity...

163
00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.371
Layman's terms.

164
00:15:56.455 --> 00:15:59.415
Fuck layman's terms.
Do you speak English?

165
00:16:03.587 --> 00:16:06.547
Imagine, for a minute,
that this piece of paper...

166
00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:10.051
Excuse me.
That's Vanessa, and that's mine.

167
00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:12.929
Attractive piece of paper
represents space-time

168
00:16:13.055 --> 00:16:17.266
and you want to get from
point "A" here

169
00:16:17.393 --> 00:16:19.185
to "B" there.

170
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:22.355
Now, what's the shortest distance
between two points?

171
00:16:22.439 --> 00:16:23.898
A straight line.

172
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:25.733
Wrong.

173
00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:28.778
The shortest distance
between two points is zero.

174
00:16:28.904 --> 00:16:30.989
And that's what the gateway does.

175
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.492
It folds space.

176
00:16:34.576 --> 00:16:39.330
So that point "A" and point "B"
co-exist in the same space and time.

177
00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:44.377
When the spacecraft passes
through the gateway,

178
00:16:44.461 --> 00:16:46.504
space returns to normal.

179
00:16:46.922 --> 00:16:49.257
It's called a gravity drive.

180
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.803
- How do you know all this?
- I built it.

181
00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:56.431
Well, I can see why they sent you.

182
00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:59.225
So if the ship didn't blow up,
then what happened?

183
00:16:59.309 --> 00:17:03.354
Well, the mission was going
perfectly, like a textbook.

184
00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:05.940
They reached safe distance
using conventional thrusters.

185
00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:07.900
All systems looked good.

186
00:17:07.985 --> 00:17:09.944
They had the go-ahead to use
the gravity drive

187
00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:12.697
to open the gateway
to Proxima Centauri

188
00:17:13.282 --> 00:17:16.159
and then,
they just disappeared.

189
00:17:16.368 --> 00:17:20.079
Vanished without a trace,
until now.

190
00:17:20.164 --> 00:17:23.166
Where's she been for the
last seven years, Doctor?

191
00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:26.294
That's what we're here
to find out.

192
00:17:26.378 --> 00:17:29.630
Now, we've been unable
to verity live contact,

193
00:17:30.632 --> 00:17:34.343
but TDRS did receive
this single transmission.

194
00:17:45.022 --> 00:17:47.565
- What the fucking hell is that?
- Listen to this.

195
00:17:47.649 --> 00:17:51.152
Houston passed the same recording
through several filters,

196
00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:55.364
managed to isolate what appears
to be a human voice.

197
00:18:03.373 --> 00:18:05.792
I'm not even sure
if it qualifies as language.

198
00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:07.919
- Latin.
- What?

199
00:18:08.504 --> 00:18:11.172
I mean,
I think it sounds like Latin.

200
00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:14.008
- Can you translate it?
- Play it again.

201
00:18:18.138 --> 00:18:20.681
Right there. You hear that?

202
00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:27.939
Sounds like, "Liberate me,"
something or other.

203
00:18:28.023 --> 00:18:29.065
I can't make out the rest.

204
00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:30.900
"Liberate me?"

205
00:18:31.985 --> 00:18:33.694
Save me.

206
00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:37.907
All right. Stations, people.

207
00:18:51.505 --> 00:18:55.716
Crossing the Horizon.
Optimum approach angle is 14 degrees.

208
00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:59.303
- Come around to 334.
- Heading 334, sir.

209
00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:02.140
Make your approach vector
negative, 14 degrees.

210
00:19:02.224 --> 00:19:03.391
1-4 degrees.

211
00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:10.439
We have lock on Event Horizon's
navigation beacon.

212
00:19:11.108 --> 00:19:12.570
She's in the upper ionosphere

213
00:19:12.576 --> 00:19:15.945
and it looks like we're in
for some very heavy chop, sir.

214
00:19:19.658 --> 00:19:22.618
- Bring us in nice and tight, Mr. Smith.
- Sir.

215
00:19:22.703 --> 00:19:26.539
- Mr. Justin, how's my ship?
- Smooth sailing, sir.

216
00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:28.749
Matching speed on my mark.

217
00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:33.212
Three, two, one. Mark.

218
00:19:37.092 --> 00:19:40.261
- Range?
- 10.000 meters and closing, sir.

219
00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:41.429
- Starck.
- Yes, sir.

220
00:19:41.513 --> 00:19:43.431
Get on the horn.
See if anybody is listening.

221
00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:45.516
This is the US Aerospace
command vessel

222
00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:49.604
Lewis and Clark hailing Event Horizon.
Event Horizon, do you read?

223
00:19:49.688 --> 00:19:50.980
Dr. Weir.

224
00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:55.610
- I think you'll want to see this.
- Where is she?

225
00:19:55.694 --> 00:19:57.653
Dead ahead. 5,000 meters!

226
00:19:57.738 --> 00:20:00.865
- Starck? Anybody home?
- Event Horizon, do you read?

227
00:20:00.949 --> 00:20:02.992
3,000 meters and closing!

228
00:20:07.664 --> 00:20:08.748
I can't see a thing.

229
00:20:08.832 --> 00:20:11.500
1,500 meters, sir.
We're getting too close.

230
00:20:11.585 --> 00:20:12.322
Where is it?

231
00:20:12.323 --> 00:20:14.660
The scope is lit.
It's right in front of us.

232
00:20:14.696 --> 00:20:17.381
- 1,000 meters.
- Proximity warning!

233
00:20:17.466 --> 00:20:21.135
900, 800, 700.

234
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.763
- We're right on top of her, sir!
- We're gonna hit.

235
00:20:23.847 --> 00:20:26.641
- Starck!
- It's right there! God!

236
00:20:28.602 --> 00:20:30.645
Reverse thrusters. Full!

237
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:45.409
There she is.

238
00:21:05.722 --> 00:21:07.014
Jesus.

239
00:21:07.891 --> 00:21:10.226
Very impressive ship, Doctor.

240
00:21:10.978 --> 00:21:14.355
- Thank you.
- Mr. Smith, are you up for a flyby?

241
00:21:15.065 --> 00:21:16.774
Yes, sir. Yes, I'd love to.

242
00:21:31.456 --> 00:21:34.041
That's the main airlock,
we can dock in there.

243
00:21:34.126 --> 00:21:35.960
All right, Smith.

244
00:21:36.044 --> 00:21:39.547
Use the arm and lock us
onto that small antenna cluster.

245
00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:50.766
We should go very carefully here.
That's not a load-bearing structure.

246
00:21:52.519 --> 00:21:54.603
Is now, Doctor.

247
00:21:57.441 --> 00:22:00.693
- Everything five by five?
- Locked in to the Event Horizon.

248
00:22:00.777 --> 00:22:02.903
Thank you, Smitty.
Light them if you got them.

249
00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:05.239
Thank you very much, sir.

250
00:22:06.408 --> 00:22:09.577
- Starck, give me a read.
- The reactor's still hot.

251
00:22:09.661 --> 00:22:11.871
We've got several
small radiation sources,

252
00:22:11.955 --> 00:22:13.998
but no leaks.
Probably it's nothing serious.

253
00:22:14.082 --> 00:22:15.583
- Do they have pressure?
- Affirmative.

254
00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:20.421
The hull's intact, but there's no gravity,
and the thermal units are off-line.

255
00:22:20.505 --> 00:22:22.214
I'm showing deep cold.

256
00:22:22.299 --> 00:22:24.592
The crew couldn't survive
unless they were in stasis.

257
00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:26.969
- Find them, Starck.
- Yeah, I'm already on it, Captain.

258
00:22:27.054 --> 00:22:28.721
Bio-scan on the line.

259
00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:33.351
There's something wrong
with the scan.

260
00:22:33.435 --> 00:22:36.562
- Is it radiation interference?
- There's not enough to throw it off.

261
00:22:36.646 --> 00:22:40.524
I'm picking up trace life forms,
but I can't get a lock on their location.

262
00:22:40.609 --> 00:22:43.486
These readings are all over the ship.
It doesn't make any sense.

263
00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:46.989
Okay, we do it the hard way.
Deck by deck, room by room.

264
00:22:47.074 --> 00:22:48.699
Starck, deploy the umbilicus.

265
00:22:48.784 --> 00:22:50.659
Smitty, fire up the boards
in the war room.

266
00:22:50.744 --> 00:22:52.495
Sir.

267
00:22:52.579 --> 00:22:54.705
Mr. Justin,
I believe you're up for a walk?

268
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.165
Yes, sir.

269
00:23:00.253 --> 00:23:02.213
Doctor, I'm gonna need you
here on the bridge.

270
00:23:02.297 --> 00:23:03.631
Captain..

271
00:23:03.799 --> 00:23:06.217
I didn't come out all this way
just to sit on your bridge.

272
00:23:06.301 --> 00:23:08.552
- I need to be on that ship.
- Once we've secured the ship,

273
00:23:08.637 --> 00:23:10.540
- we'll bring you on board.
- No, I'm sorry, that's unacceptable.

274
00:23:10.541 --> 00:23:12.982
- I need to be on that ship.
- Once we've secured the ship.

275
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:14.433
That's the way it is.

276
00:23:14.518 --> 00:23:16.310
I need you to guide us
from the com station.

277
00:23:16.395 --> 00:23:19.438
This is where I need you.
Help us do our job.

278
00:23:32.994 --> 00:23:35.788
Honey, honey,
you forgot your briefcase.

279
00:23:47.175 --> 00:23:48.592
Stand clear.

280
00:23:50.846 --> 00:23:54.140
- Anything gets funky, Cooper...
- I'll be on it.

281
00:23:55.851 --> 00:23:58.936
Yo, Baby Bear,
keep your nose clean.

282
00:24:06.361 --> 00:24:08.028
D.J., showtime.

283
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:12.450
Video feed is clear.

284
00:24:12.534 --> 00:24:16.120
- Are you with us, Dr. Weir?
- Yes, I'm with you.

285
00:24:16.872 --> 00:24:18.622
We are crossing the umbilicus,

286
00:24:18.707 --> 00:24:21.625
making our approach
to the Event Horizon.

287
00:24:23.837 --> 00:24:26.338
You're at the outer airlock door.

288
00:24:27.966 --> 00:24:29.508
Magnetic boots on.

289
00:24:35.348 --> 00:24:37.057
We've got pressure.

290
00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:58.704
Place is a deep freeze.

291
00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:03.417
We got ice crystals everywhere.

292
00:25:04.753 --> 00:25:07.004
That's the central corridor
that you're in now.

293
00:25:07.088 --> 00:25:09.673
It connects the personnel areas
at the front of the ship

294
00:25:09.758 --> 00:25:11.342
to Engineering at the rear.

295
00:25:13.595 --> 00:25:16.263
- Mr. Justin, you take Engineering.
- Yes, sir.

296
00:25:16.389 --> 00:25:19.350
Peters and I'll take
the forward decks.

297
00:25:29.277 --> 00:25:31.278
Doctor, what are these?

298
00:25:32.239 --> 00:25:35.699
Yeah, I've got another one over here.
They are all over the place.

299
00:25:35.784 --> 00:25:36.867
In an emergency,

300
00:25:36.952 --> 00:25:40.454
they destroy the central corridor
and split the ship in half

301
00:25:41.623 --> 00:25:44.625
and then the crew can use
the foredecks as a lifeboat.

302
00:25:50.257 --> 00:25:53.884
I'm in Medical. No casualties.

303
00:25:57.931 --> 00:26:00.140
Place looks like it's never
been used.

304
00:26:00.225 --> 00:26:01.592
You still haven't seen any crew?

305
00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.770
If we saw any crew, Doctor,
you'd know it by now.

306
00:26:05.981 --> 00:26:08.148
Scanning for life readings.

307
00:26:11.444 --> 00:26:13.487
This place is a tomb.

308
00:26:16.658 --> 00:26:18.117
Fuck me!

309
00:26:18.994 --> 00:26:20.995
Miller. Miller, are you okay?

310
00:26:21.413 --> 00:26:23.747
Looks like Skipper got a case
of the willies.

311
00:26:23.832 --> 00:26:25.916
Cooper, get back to your post.

312
00:26:26.167 --> 00:26:28.419
Miller, your heart rate
just went through the roof.

313
00:26:28.503 --> 00:26:30.004
I'm fine.

314
00:26:36.511 --> 00:26:40.097
I think I've reached the door
to the first containment, Dr. Weir.

315
00:26:40.265 --> 00:26:42.433
The Engineering decks
are on the other side.

316
00:26:42.517 --> 00:26:44.643
Okay, let's take a look.

317
00:27:01.995 --> 00:27:05.122
What the hell is this place, Dr. Weir?

318
00:27:05.206 --> 00:27:07.291
It allows you to enter
the second containment

319
00:27:07.375 --> 00:27:10.044
without compromising
the magnetic fields.

320
00:27:11.713 --> 00:27:14.214
Looks like a meat grinder to me.

321
00:27:18.345 --> 00:27:20.054
I'm on the bridge.

322
00:27:27.854 --> 00:27:30.064
Got some blood here.

323
00:27:43.745 --> 00:27:48.040
There must have been a coolant leak.
Man, this shit is everywhere.

324
00:27:49.959 --> 00:27:53.796
Coolant level's on reserve,
but well within the safety line.

325
00:28:05.433 --> 00:28:08.143
Miss Peters,
could you turn back and left?

326
00:28:09.938 --> 00:28:12.731
- What is it?
- Ship's log.

327
00:28:32.419 --> 00:28:33.961
It's stuck.

328
00:28:35.922 --> 00:28:38.757
It's pretty jammed in there.

329
00:28:47.016 --> 00:28:49.435
What the hell happened to his eyes?

330
00:28:49.519 --> 00:28:53.355
- Explosive decompression.
- Decompression doesn't do that.

331
00:28:55.024 --> 00:28:58.986
Looks like it was caused by...
I don't know, an animal or something.

332
00:28:59.112 --> 00:29:02.614
Look at the damage to the
soft tissue, massive abrasions.

333
00:29:03.158 --> 00:29:04.867
Corpse-sicle.

334
00:29:07.287 --> 00:29:09.538
I'm scanning for life forms.

335
00:29:14.627 --> 00:29:18.213
Man, I'm getting some
really strange readings in here.

336
00:29:30.185 --> 00:29:33.020
Let me see if I can get
some power up.

337
00:29:43.907 --> 00:29:45.866
That's the core,
the gravity drive.

338
00:29:52.081 --> 00:29:54.041
The heart of the ship.

339
00:30:09.891 --> 00:30:13.227
Justin. Justin, you're breaking up.

340
00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:25.739
Justin, come in.

341
00:30:37.293 --> 00:30:38.420
- What is it?
- I don't know.

342
00:30:38.426 --> 00:30:40.504
The life scan just went off the scale.

343
00:30:51.641 --> 00:30:53.976
Something's wrong, Starck.
Pull him out. Pull him out.

344
00:30:59.983 --> 00:31:01.358
Shit!

345
00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:06.864
He's in trouble.

346
00:31:06.948 --> 00:31:09.116
- Go, Coop.
- I'm gone.

347
00:31:47.864 --> 00:31:50.157
Boarding party, sound off.

348
00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:53.243
This is Miller.
Can anybody hear me?

349
00:31:59.584 --> 00:32:02.711
- What the fuck was that?
- Pressure emergency!

350
00:32:02.837 --> 00:32:06.089
We've lost the starboard baffle.
The hull's been breached!

351
00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:09.801
I'll contain it here for
as long as I can! Get out!

352
00:32:09.886 --> 00:32:11.929
We're losing atmosphere.

353
00:32:13.514 --> 00:32:16.308
There are pressure suits
in the airlock. Go!

354
00:32:16.392 --> 00:32:18.143
Here I come. Here I come.

355
00:32:22.523 --> 00:32:24.358
Hold on, Baby Bear.

356
00:32:24.692 --> 00:32:26.735
I'm almost there, almost there.

357
00:32:31.532 --> 00:32:33.408
I got you. I got...

358
00:32:34.243 --> 00:32:36.119
Watch out. Watch...

359
00:32:37.413 --> 00:32:40.248
I got you. What the fuck is this?

360
00:32:40.875 --> 00:32:42.125
Hold on.

361
00:32:44.879 --> 00:32:47.881
Captain Miller.
Captain Miller, do you copy? Over.

362
00:32:48.216 --> 00:32:51.969
- Smitty, where you been all my life?
- We have a major situation here, sir.

363
00:32:52.053 --> 00:32:55.472
We've lost the starboard baffle,
and the hull's been breached.

364
00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.266
The safety circuits,
they have failed.

365
00:32:58.393 --> 00:33:00.185
- Do we have time for a weld?
- No, sir.

366
00:33:00.269 --> 00:33:04.356
We've got 218 liters of gas left, sir,
and then we've got nothing.

367
00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.984
The oxygen tanks, they failed,
they're broken.

368
00:33:07.068 --> 00:33:10.320
- Sir, we are fucking dead!
- What about the Event Horizon?

369
00:33:10.822 --> 00:33:12.072
What?

370
00:33:12.156 --> 00:33:14.992
- She's got air and power.
- It's our only chance.

371
00:33:15.076 --> 00:33:17.202
There's no way
I'm getting on that bastard.

372
00:33:17.286 --> 00:33:18.996
We don't even know
what happened on that ship.

373
00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.914
It beats dying, Mr. Smith.

374
00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:25.085
I want all personnel on board
the Event Horizon, pronto.

375
00:33:25.586 --> 00:33:28.171
- We'll meet at the air tanks.
- I'm ahead of you, sir.

376
00:33:28.256 --> 00:33:31.133
Bringing all thermal units online.

377
00:33:31.259 --> 00:33:34.136
Hold tight. Prep for G's.

378
00:33:34.429 --> 00:33:36.513
Gravity in five seconds.

379
00:33:51.612 --> 00:33:54.823
Wake up, open your eyes. All right?
Just hang in there.

380
00:34:18.973 --> 00:34:20.348
Dr. Weir.

381
00:34:21.893 --> 00:34:22.985
Well,

382
00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:26.146
I brought most primary
systems online.

383
00:34:26.856 --> 00:34:28.106
- For now.
- Thank you.

384
00:34:28.191 --> 00:34:31.985
- Starck, what's our status?
- The antenna array is completely fried.

385
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:35.280
We've got no radio,
no laser, no high gain.

386
00:34:35.364 --> 00:34:37.199
No one's coming to help us.

387
00:34:37.742 --> 00:34:40.285
- This air tastes bad.
- Yeah, carbon dioxide, I know.

388
00:34:40.369 --> 00:34:42.662
It's building up
with every breath we take.

389
00:34:42.747 --> 00:34:45.290
And the CO2 filters
on the Event Horizon are shot.

390
00:34:45.374 --> 00:34:46.917
So, we take the scrubbers
from the Clark.

391
00:34:47.001 --> 00:34:50.003
- That gives us what?
- Enough breathable air for 20 hours,

392
00:34:50.088 --> 00:34:52.255
but after that,
we'd better be on our way home.

393
00:35:08.606 --> 00:35:12.275
I'm on the port side of the hull,
approaching the dorsal heat sink.

394
00:35:16.322 --> 00:35:17.697
Holy shit.

395
00:35:23.788 --> 00:35:26.248
Captain Miller. Captain Miller,
do you copy? Over.

396
00:35:26.332 --> 00:35:28.708
I copy, Mr. Smith. How's my ship?

397
00:35:28.793 --> 00:35:31.530
Sir, we've got a 7-meter fracture
on the outer hull.

398
00:35:31.554 --> 00:35:33.066
We should be able to repair her,

399
00:35:33.067 --> 00:35:34.767
but it is gonna take
an awful lot of time, sir.

400
00:35:35.033 --> 00:35:37.717
Negative.
20 hours, we run out of air.

401
00:35:37.802 --> 00:35:39.136
Understood, sir.

402
00:35:41.764 --> 00:35:43.598
What happened here, Doctor?

403
00:35:55.069 --> 00:35:57.487
Okay, how is he?

404
00:35:58.072 --> 00:36:02.117
His vital signs seem stable,
but he's unresponsive to stimuli.

405
00:36:02.785 --> 00:36:04.035
I don't know.

406
00:36:08.624 --> 00:36:10.584
He might wake up in 15 minutes.

407
00:36:12.587 --> 00:36:14.421
He might not wake up at all.

408
00:36:15.214 --> 00:36:17.257
Look, Skipper,
I know this shit sounds weird, but..

409
00:36:17.341 --> 00:36:21.035
I mean, there was like nothing,
and then Justin appeared,

410
00:36:21.038 --> 00:36:26.516
and it was liquid, and the whole
core just turned solid.

411
00:36:26.601 --> 00:36:28.268
It's just not physically possible.

412
00:36:28.352 --> 00:36:31.100
Doctor, please. Please,
don't start in with that physics shit.

413
00:36:31.101 --> 00:36:33.356
I'm telling you, I saw it.

414
00:36:33.441 --> 00:36:35.942
Mr. Cooper,
it would mean the gateway was open.

415
00:36:36.027 --> 00:36:39.821
- That's it. The gateway was open.
- The gateway couldn't be open

416
00:36:39.906 --> 00:36:42.124
because the gravity drive
wasn't activated.

417
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:43.740
Look, I'm telling you
what I saw, Doc! So...

418
00:36:43.745 --> 00:36:48.622
- It can't just start up by itself.
- Mr. Cooper, you are out of line.

419
00:36:49.749 --> 00:36:52.918
Doctor, Mr. Justin may die.
Now, I have to assume

420
00:36:53.002 --> 00:36:56.379
that whatever happened to him
could happen to all of us.

421
00:36:56.464 --> 00:37:01.176
Mr. Cooper says he saw something.
I believe he saw something.

422
00:37:02.053 --> 00:37:04.304
I need an explanation.

423
00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:12.020
In my view, Mr. Cooper's delusional,
if you don't mind my saying so.

424
00:37:12.104 --> 00:37:15.490
But maybe he saw an optical effect

425
00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.359
caused by gravitational distortion.

426
00:37:17.443 --> 00:37:19.527
"An optical effect"?
That's fucking poetic.

427
00:37:19.612 --> 00:37:21.488
- Where the fuck...
- Cooper!

428
00:37:21.572 --> 00:37:23.698
I'm sorry. All right.

429
00:37:25.826 --> 00:37:28.954
Gravitational distortion.
What could create that, Doctor?

430
00:37:29.038 --> 00:37:33.458
If, somehow, a burst of gravity
waves escaped from the core,

431
00:37:34.585 --> 00:37:36.163
it could distort space-time.

432
00:37:36.164 --> 00:37:38.420
It could make Justin
seem to disappear.

433
00:37:38.447 --> 00:37:42.008
It could also have damaged
the Lewis and Clark.

434
00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:44.920
However,
I think this is entirely unlikely.

435
00:37:44.921 --> 00:37:46.835
What's in the core, Doctor?

436
00:37:48.724 --> 00:37:49.891
It's complicated.

437
00:37:49.976 --> 00:37:52.727
How much time do you need?
We have..

438
00:37:52.812 --> 00:37:55.313
17 hours and 48 minutes.

439
00:37:56.565 --> 00:37:58.358
What's in the core?

440
00:38:00.319 --> 00:38:02.821
This is the gateway.

441
00:38:02.905 --> 00:38:05.782
Now, these three magnetic rings,
when they align,

442
00:38:05.786 --> 00:38:08.118
it creates an artificial black hole

443
00:38:08.202 --> 00:38:10.912
which allows the ship to travel
to any point in space.

444
00:38:10.997 --> 00:38:14.791
A black hole, the most destructive
force in the universe.

445
00:38:15.209 --> 00:38:17.752
- And you've created one?
- Absolutely, yes.

446
00:38:17.837 --> 00:38:22.924
Because we can use that
immense power to bend space-time.

447
00:38:23.009 --> 00:38:26.594
Look, it would take the
Lewis and Clark 1,000 years

448
00:38:26.679 --> 00:38:28.330
to reach our nearest star.

449
00:38:28.815 --> 00:38:31.474
But the Event Horizon
could be there in a day.

450
00:38:31.559 --> 00:38:32.480
If it worked.

451
00:38:32.481 --> 00:38:34.481
You can come down.
It's perfectly safe.

452
00:38:40.443 --> 00:38:43.403
So, if Mr. Justin was sucked
through your gateway,

453
00:38:43.487 --> 00:38:45.989
he could've gone wherever
the Event Horizon's been.

454
00:38:46.073 --> 00:38:47.200
Theoretically, yes.

455
00:38:47.201 --> 00:38:51.120
But as I told you before, the gateway
can't just open by itself.

456
00:38:51.217 --> 00:38:52.495
I see.

457
00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.289
Lieutenant,
I want this room sealed off.

458
00:38:54.373 --> 00:38:56.249
Second containment from
here on in is off-limits.

459
00:38:56.334 --> 00:38:58.960
- Yes, sir.
- Captain, there's no danger.

460
00:38:59.045 --> 00:39:01.087
The gateway's contained
behind three magnetic fields.

461
00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:03.757
- It's perfectly safe.
- Safe?

462
00:39:03.841 --> 00:39:06.940
Doctor, my ship is in pieces and one of
my crewmen may not make it home alive.

463
00:39:08.095 --> 00:39:10.597
No one else goes near this thing.

464
00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.452
Come on.

465
00:39:34.538 --> 00:39:37.457
There's got to be something
on this log.

466
00:39:38.542 --> 00:39:40.210
You can do this.

467
00:39:44.131 --> 00:39:45.340
D.J.?

468
00:40:05.528 --> 00:40:09.030
- D.J., where are you?
- I'm up on Deck 4.

469
00:41:02.835 --> 00:41:04.043
Mommy.

470
00:41:16.891 --> 00:41:18.141
Peters!

471
00:41:24.565 --> 00:41:26.733
What is it? You all right?

472
00:41:43.751 --> 00:41:46.002
What's up?
You was out there so long,

473
00:41:46.036 --> 00:41:47.837
I thought you were
trying to break my record.

474
00:41:47.922 --> 00:41:51.254
Listen, I'd rather spend the
next 12 hours outside

475
00:41:51.258 --> 00:41:53.635
than another five seconds
in this shit can.

476
00:41:53.719 --> 00:41:56.095
It's the final entry in the ship's log.

477
00:41:56.597 --> 00:41:59.432
I want to say how proud
I am of my crew.

478
00:41:59.558 --> 00:42:01.684
I'd like to name my station heads:

479
00:42:01.769 --> 00:42:03.853
Chris Chambers, Janice Reuben,

480
00:42:04.563 --> 00:42:07.023
Ben Fender, Dick Smith.

481
00:42:09.235 --> 00:42:10.652
We've reached safe distance...

482
00:42:10.736 --> 00:42:12.445
This is John Kilpack, ship's captain.

483
00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:15.949
...and we're preparing to engage
the gravity drive,

484
00:42:16.075 --> 00:42:18.952
and open the gateway
to Proxima Centauri.

485
00:42:22.623 --> 00:42:24.040
Hail and farewell.

486
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:34.717
- What is that?
- I'll run it through a few filters,

487
00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.928
see if I can clean it up.

488
00:42:40.933 --> 00:42:43.476
- It's a power drain.
- It's the core.

489
00:42:44.979 --> 00:42:46.729
Stay here. Look after Justin.

490
00:42:46.814 --> 00:42:48.648
I don't want anybody else
near that thing.

491
00:42:48.732 --> 00:42:49.941
Wait for me, Doctor.

492
00:42:51.652 --> 00:42:55.405
- What's causing the drain?
- Magnetic fields are holding.

493
00:42:55.489 --> 00:42:58.741
Maybe a short in the
fail-safe circuit. I'll check it.

494
00:42:58.826 --> 00:43:00.410
Can you give us a hand?

495
00:43:21.348 --> 00:43:22.640
Justin.

496
00:43:23.017 --> 00:43:24.684
Justin, can you hear me?

497
00:43:25.644 --> 00:43:27.812
- He's coming.
- Who's coming?

498
00:43:29.857 --> 00:43:31.649
The dark.

499
00:43:48.667 --> 00:43:50.877
Yeah, that's the one.

500
00:44:04.183 --> 00:44:05.321
Billy.

501
00:44:16.822 --> 00:44:17.880
Billy.

502
00:44:33.081 --> 00:44:33.781
Billy.

503
00:44:45.391 --> 00:44:46.641
Miller!

504
00:44:47.601 --> 00:44:49.435
Captain Miller!

505
00:44:49.561 --> 00:44:51.771
I've got some problems here.

506
00:44:56.944 --> 00:44:58.444
Be with me,

507
00:44:59.446 --> 00:45:00.738
forever.

508
00:45:09.164 --> 00:45:10.498
Dr. Weir?

509
00:45:37.317 --> 00:45:40.236
Carbon dioxide can produce
hallucinations, impair judgment.

510
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:42.405
God damn it, D.J.,
it was not a hallucination.

511
00:45:42.489 --> 00:45:43.865
All right.

512
00:45:44.032 --> 00:45:46.325
Doctor, you were in the duct.

513
00:45:46.535 --> 00:45:48.953
You must have heard something.

514
00:45:50.164 --> 00:45:52.832
- You must have seen something.
- I did.

515
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.585
About an hour ago, I saw my son

516
00:45:55.669 --> 00:45:58.165
lying on the examination table

517
00:45:59.167 --> 00:46:02.967
- and in his legs were...
- Miss Peters...

518
00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:04.886
- ..if you don't mind my saying so,
- ...crawling...

519
00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:05.835
it sounds a little like shock.

520
00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:07.539
- Could it be that you're traumatized...
- No. No.

521
00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:10.892
- ...by seeing the body on the...
- Excuse me. No!

522
00:46:12.519 --> 00:46:15.104
I've seen bodies before.
This was different.

523
00:46:15.189 --> 00:46:17.106
She's right. Now, this was real.

524
00:46:17.191 --> 00:46:19.659
I felt... I felt heat.

525
00:46:19.985 --> 00:46:22.862
This is not something
that's in our heads.

526
00:46:24.698 --> 00:46:27.992
Smitty, have you seen
anything unusual at all?

527
00:46:28.535 --> 00:46:30.818
No, I haven't seen anything,
and I don't need to see anything, sir,

528
00:46:30.823 --> 00:46:34.650
but I can tell you...
this ship is fucked.

529
00:46:35.501 --> 00:46:38.127
Thank you for that
scientific analysis, Mr. Smith.

530
00:46:38.212 --> 00:46:40.296
Well, you don't expect
to figure it out, do you?

531
00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:41.339
All right, Doc.

532
00:46:41.423 --> 00:46:42.500
When you break
all the laws of physics,

533
00:46:42.516 --> 00:46:43.883
you seriously think
there won't be a price?

534
00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:47.470
You already killed the last fucking crew.
And now you want to kill us as well!

535
00:46:47.554 --> 00:46:50.014
- It's just a fucking ship, all right?
- D.J.!

536
00:46:50.098 --> 00:46:53.184
It's just a ship, do you understand?
It's just a big hunk of metal.

537
00:46:53.268 --> 00:46:56.062
- There's nothing odd going on.
- D.J.?

538
00:47:00.067 --> 00:47:02.193
- Fine.
- D.J.?

539
00:47:05.614 --> 00:47:08.032
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm just...

540
00:47:08.742 --> 00:47:10.076
I'm sorry.

541
00:47:10.244 --> 00:47:11.786
- Damn it!
- Smitty.

542
00:47:11.912 --> 00:47:13.996
- It's all right. That's it.
- Fucking...

543
00:47:14.081 --> 00:47:17.583
That's enough! I want you calm,
I want you cool! Now!

544
00:47:19.419 --> 00:47:22.171
- All right.
- You're going back upstairs.

545
00:47:22.256 --> 00:47:24.382
You're going outside on the
Clark with Cooper,

546
00:47:24.386 --> 00:47:26.884
and you're going to repair the ship.
No mistakes.

547
00:47:26.969 --> 00:47:29.762
Mistakes, nobody goes home.
Understood?

548
00:47:30.597 --> 00:47:32.473
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

549
00:47:33.141 --> 00:47:34.892
- Sir.
- Get moving.

550
00:47:41.984 --> 00:47:43.693
- Miller.
- What is it, Starck?

551
00:47:43.777 --> 00:47:46.487
I ran the bio-scan
with the DNA-RNA filters.

552
00:47:46.613 --> 00:47:47.902
The results were bio readings...

553
00:47:47.906 --> 00:47:49.532
Of an indeterminate origin.
Yes, I know.

554
00:47:49.616 --> 00:47:52.368
Don't you have anything useful
to tell me, Lieutenant?

555
00:47:52.452 --> 00:47:55.246
- I've got a theory.
- Let's hear it.

556
00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:58.833
I think that there's a connection between
the readings and the hallucinations,

557
00:47:58.837 --> 00:48:01.580
like they're all part
of a defensive reaction,

558
00:48:01.586 --> 00:48:02.587
some sort of immune system.

559
00:48:02.671 --> 00:48:04.255
I don't have time to listen to this.

560
00:48:04.339 --> 00:48:05.798
- You have to listen to me.
- To what?

561
00:48:05.883 --> 00:48:09.385
I'm saying that this ship is reacting to us
and the reactions are getting stronger.

562
00:48:09.469 --> 00:48:11.275
It's as if the ship
brought back something with it,

563
00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:13.014
a life force of some kind.

564
00:48:13.098 --> 00:48:15.725
What are you telling me?
That this ship is alive?

565
00:48:15.809 --> 00:48:18.519
You wanted an answer,
and it's the only one I've got.

566
00:48:18.604 --> 00:48:22.106
No, what I want, Lieutenant,
is to survive the next 10 hours.

567
00:49:06.985 --> 00:49:08.235
Justin?

568
00:49:09.571 --> 00:49:10.901
Justin!

569
00:49:14.602 --> 00:49:15.650
Justin!

570
00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.130
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?

571
00:50:09.214 --> 00:50:10.506
- What's that?
- What is it?

572
00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:11.608
- You heard it.
- What did you hear?

573
00:50:11.612 --> 00:50:13.509
- What is it?
- Peters, listen to me.

574
00:50:13.593 --> 00:50:14.885
It's D.J., all right?

575
00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:16.735
I didn't hear anything.
Neither of us heard anything.

576
00:50:16.755 --> 00:50:18.347
- So just calm down, all right?
- Okay.

577
00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:20.433
- Get your breath back.
- Okay.

578
00:50:20.559 --> 00:50:22.643
- Now, tell me.
- I was...

579
00:50:27.065 --> 00:50:29.817
Make it stop! Make it stop!

580
00:50:31.236 --> 00:50:32.778
Open the door.

581
00:50:34.239 --> 00:50:35.740
Stop moving!

582
00:50:38.618 --> 00:50:41.495
- No!
- Weir, stop. Stop him!

583
00:50:41.621 --> 00:50:43.456
What're you doing?

584
00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:50.629
In our current environment, Dr. Weir,
self-control is an asset.

585
00:50:56.845 --> 00:50:58.304
What is it?

586
00:50:59.181 --> 00:51:01.015
The forward airlock.

587
00:51:01.308 --> 00:51:04.101
Miller, Smith, Cooper,
anyone in the airlock?

588
00:51:04.186 --> 00:51:05.978
That's a negative, Starck.

589
00:51:06.646 --> 00:51:07.855
Justin.

590
00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:12.318
- Justin.
- Don't!

591
00:51:12.444 --> 00:51:13.986
Justin, no!

592
00:51:14.112 --> 00:51:16.947
Justin, no! Justin, open the door.

593
00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:19.867
Miller, come in.

594
00:51:19.993 --> 00:51:22.828
Miller, come in.
We have an emergency.

595
00:51:22.954 --> 00:51:24.789
What's going on in there, Starck?

596
00:51:24.873 --> 00:51:27.416
- Justin's in the airlock.
- Say again.

597
00:51:27.501 --> 00:51:30.377
Justin is in the airlock
and he is not wearing a suit.

598
00:51:30.462 --> 00:51:32.838
- Shit. I'm on it.
- As you were, sailor.

599
00:51:32.964 --> 00:51:35.466
- Skipper, you need me on this.
- I need you right where you are.

600
00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:37.384
He's engaged the override.

601
00:51:37.511 --> 00:51:39.512
- Can you shut it down?
- I'll try.

602
00:51:40.013 --> 00:51:41.263
Coming to him, Starck.

603
00:51:41.348 --> 00:51:44.225
Justin! Open this door, now!

604
00:51:47.979 --> 00:51:49.313
Starck, give me status.

605
00:51:49.397 --> 00:51:51.315
You better hurry.
He's engaged the override

606
00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:53.609
- and we can't open the inner door.
- I'll get the kit.

607
00:51:53.693 --> 00:51:56.487
Justin, open the door!

608
00:52:00.867 --> 00:52:04.036
Justin, open the door.

609
00:52:04.162 --> 00:52:06.455
- Did you hear it?
- Keep him talking.

610
00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:09.959
Yes. Yes, I heard it.
Do you know what it is?

611
00:52:10.043 --> 00:52:12.044
It shows you things,

612
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:15.381
- horrible things.
- What does?

613
00:52:15.465 --> 00:52:19.718
The dark inside me
from the other place.

614
00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:22.972
- I won't go back there. I won't.
- No, Baby Bear.

615
00:52:23.056 --> 00:52:24.807
- Come on, open the door.
- What's happening?

616
00:52:24.891 --> 00:52:27.143
- I don't think she can talk him down.
- She'd better.

617
00:52:27.227 --> 00:52:28.785
If he opens the airlock,
he's going to turn inside out.

618
00:52:28.788 --> 00:52:31.981
- No. No, you stay with me.
- Almost got it.

619
00:52:32.065 --> 00:52:34.441
- I've almost got it.
- You stay with me, Justin.

620
00:52:34.526 --> 00:52:36.152
Come on, now. Open that door!

621
00:52:36.236 --> 00:52:39.655
If you could see the things I've seen,
you wouldn't try to stop me.

622
00:52:39.739 --> 00:52:41.949
No, that's not you talking.
That's not you talking.

623
00:52:42.033 --> 00:52:44.076
That's it. That's it, right there.

624
00:52:44.161 --> 00:52:46.829
Open the door. Go for that button.
Come on.

625
00:52:46.913 --> 00:52:48.080
Okay.

626
00:52:50.083 --> 00:52:51.083
No!

627
00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:56.922
Captain, Justin just activated the door.
It's on a 30-second delay.

628
00:52:57.007 --> 00:52:59.091
Justin!

629
00:53:02.721 --> 00:53:06.432
Stand by for decompression
in 25 seconds.

630
00:53:07.434 --> 00:53:09.351
Where am I?

631
00:53:09.895 --> 00:53:11.275
- Hey.
- Starck, get it fucking open!

632
00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:12.738
- Hey, open the door.
- I can't.

633
00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:15.324
The inner door won't open when
the outside door's been triggered.

634
00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:17.693
- It'd decompress the entire ship.
- Oh, my God.

635
00:53:17.777 --> 00:53:20.613
Mama Bear, open the door.

636
00:53:20.739 --> 00:53:22.406
Come on, please.

637
00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:25.367
- Captain!
- Patch me through to him.

638
00:53:25.452 --> 00:53:27.203
Captain Miller, tell them
to open the door.

639
00:53:27.287 --> 00:53:29.121
They can't do that, Justin.

640
00:53:29.206 --> 00:53:32.041
- I don't want to die in here.
- You're not gonna die.

641
00:53:32.125 --> 00:53:36.337
I want you to listen to me very carefully,
and I'm gonna get you out of there.

642
00:53:39.466 --> 00:53:40.925
Oh, my God.

643
00:53:41.259 --> 00:53:42.801
It's starting.

644
00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:45.721
- My eyes.
- Don't think about them. Shut them.

645
00:53:45.805 --> 00:53:47.973
Just shut them as tight as you can.

646
00:53:48.099 --> 00:53:49.183
Five seconds.

647
00:53:49.267 --> 00:53:52.561
Tuck yourself into a crouch position.
Make yourself into a ball now.

648
00:53:52.646 --> 00:53:55.731
I can't breathe. Oh, God.

649
00:53:55.982 --> 00:53:58.234
Oh, God, it hurts.

650
00:53:58.318 --> 00:54:02.571
I want you to huff and puff and
blow all the air out of your lungs.

651
00:54:02.656 --> 00:54:05.658
Do you hear me?
All the air out of your lungs, Justin.

652
00:54:07.327 --> 00:54:08.994
Do it, now!

653
00:54:21.007 --> 00:54:22.675
Okay, Baby Bear.

654
00:54:24.511 --> 00:54:28.514
Got him. I got him.
Stand by, people.

655
00:54:28.598 --> 00:54:29.932
Standby.

656
00:54:31.977 --> 00:54:35.437
- We've got pressure.
- We're coming, Justin. We're coming.

657
00:54:37.107 --> 00:54:40.651
I'm going to need five units here.
Hold his head still.

658
00:54:41.444 --> 00:54:42.653
Okay.

659
00:54:44.698 --> 00:54:47.032
Give me some more glycerin, now.

660
00:54:47.117 --> 00:54:48.701
One thing at a time,
let's keep him breathing.

661
00:54:48.785 --> 00:54:49.910
Christ, he's bleeding out.

662
00:54:49.995 --> 00:54:52.871
- Start the drip, 15 cc.
- Pressure's still dropping.

663
00:55:01.298 --> 00:55:04.800
I've stopped the bleeding,
stabilized him best I can.

664
00:55:06.219 --> 00:55:09.138
He won't be pretty,
but he should live...

665
00:55:09.472 --> 00:55:12.057
- If we make it back.
- We'll make it.

666
00:55:13.643 --> 00:55:15.894
Starck, what's our time like?

667
00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:18.897
CO2 levels will become toxic
in four hours.

668
00:55:19.649 --> 00:55:20.899
All right.

669
00:55:20.984 --> 00:55:23.500
Peters, we've got to find out
what happened to the other crew

670
00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:25.188
before the same thing happens to us.

671
00:55:26.573 --> 00:55:30.826
I can work on the log on the bridge,
but I won't go back to Medical.

672
00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:33.579
- Fine.
- Yes, sir.

673
00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:38.208
Justin said something about,

674
00:55:39.419 --> 00:55:41.337
"the dark inside me."

675
00:55:42.505 --> 00:55:44.256
What's that mean?

676
00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:46.342
Doctor?

677
00:55:48.511 --> 00:55:50.929
I don't think it means anything.

678
00:55:55.268 --> 00:55:57.895
Don't you walk away
from me, mister.

679
00:55:59.522 --> 00:56:01.357
I'd like some answers, Doctor.

680
00:56:01.441 --> 00:56:04.026
I'd like to know why one of
my men tried to commit suicide

681
00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:07.130
by throwing himself out of an airlock.
I'd like to know what caused that noise.

682
00:56:07.135 --> 00:56:09.990
Look, thermal changes in the hull

683
00:56:09.995 --> 00:56:13.369
could've caused the metal
to expand and contract rapidly,

684
00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:14.995
causing reverberations.
This is possible.

685
00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:19.124
Bullshit! You built this fucking ship.
You've given me nothing but bullshit.

686
00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:21.460
What do you want me to say?

687
00:56:21.711 --> 00:56:25.547
You said the ship's drive
creates a gateway.

688
00:56:25.632 --> 00:56:27.299
- Yeah.
- To what?

689
00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:30.511
- I don't know.
- Where did it go?

690
00:56:30.595 --> 00:56:33.555
- Where did you send it?
- I don't know.

691
00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:36.058
Where has it been
for the last seven years?

692
00:56:36.142 --> 00:56:37.226
Look, I don't know.

693
00:56:37.310 --> 00:56:39.395
"I don't know,"
is not good enough, Doctor.

694
00:56:39.479 --> 00:56:41.355
You're supposed to be
the fucking expert.

695
00:56:41.439 --> 00:56:43.565
I need answers. That's your job.

696
00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:47.486
- Now, the other place, where is that?
- I don't know! I don't know!

697
00:56:48.321 --> 00:56:49.405
Look,

698
00:56:50.156 --> 00:56:51.999
there's a lot of things
happening around here

699
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.744
that I don't fully understand.
I need time.

700
00:56:57.122 --> 00:56:58.330
I see.

701
00:56:58.915 --> 00:57:02.167
Well, that's exactly
what we don't have, Doctor.

702
00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:08.674
Captain!

703
00:57:14.931 --> 00:57:16.406
Don't leave me!

704
00:57:22.807 --> 00:57:24.707
Don't leave me!

705
00:57:30.029 --> 00:57:31.321
Please!

706
00:57:34.617 --> 00:57:38.495
For God's sakes, help me!

707
00:57:48.548 --> 00:57:50.299
It's in your head.

708
00:57:52.886 --> 00:57:54.887
It's just in your head.

709
00:58:14.741 --> 00:58:16.200
God help us.

710
00:58:21.998 --> 00:58:24.333
I'm telling you,
it was his voice I heard.

711
00:58:24.417 --> 00:58:28.253
He was calling to me.
A young bosun named Eddie Corrick.

712
00:58:30.089 --> 00:58:32.674
We served on the Goliath together.

713
00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:38.180
When the O2 tanks ruptured,
four of us made it to the lifeboat.

714
00:58:38.264 --> 00:58:42.684
But Corrick was still on board
the Goliath when the fire broke out.

715
00:58:43.019 --> 00:58:45.604
You ever seen fire in zero gravity?

716
00:58:47.524 --> 00:58:49.107
It's beautiful.

717
00:58:51.277 --> 00:58:53.028
It's like liquid.

718
00:58:54.113 --> 00:58:56.448
It slides all over everything.

719
00:58:57.617 --> 00:58:59.368
Comes up in waves.

720
00:59:00.912 --> 00:59:03.413
And they just kept hitting him,

721
00:59:03.790 --> 00:59:05.457
wave after wave.

722
00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:10.295
He was screaming
for me to save him.

723
00:59:11.297 --> 00:59:12.965
What did you do?

724
00:59:13.466 --> 00:59:15.801
I did the only thing I could.

725
00:59:17.804 --> 00:59:21.223
I closed the lifeboat hatch,
and I left him behind.

726
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:27.813
I swore I'd never
lose another man.

727
00:59:29.107 --> 00:59:31.275
I've known you a long time.

728
00:59:31.818 --> 00:59:32.800
You never told me that.

729
00:59:32.801 --> 00:59:35.850
That's just it, D.J.,
I never told anybody.

730
00:59:37.574 --> 00:59:39.825
But this ship knew about it.

731
00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:44.246
It knows my fears.
It knows my secrets.

732
00:59:45.498 --> 00:59:48.292
Gets inside your head,
and it shows you.

733
00:59:49.752 --> 00:59:52.170
I wasn't going to tell you this.

734
00:59:54.132 --> 00:59:57.175
I've been listening to the
distress signal.

735
00:59:57.343 --> 00:59:58.844
And I...

736
01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:03.932
I think I made a mistake
in the translation.

737
01:00:12.692 --> 01:00:13.942
Go on.

738
01:00:15.194 --> 01:00:17.529
I thought it said "liberate me."

739
01:00:18.323 --> 01:00:19.615
Save me.

740
01:00:20.992 --> 01:00:22.659
But it's not "me."

741
01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:26.204
It's "Liberate tutume."

742
01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:28.832
Save yourself.

743
01:00:29.709 --> 01:00:31.460
And it gets worse.

744
01:00:35.173 --> 01:00:36.381
There.

745
01:00:37.675 --> 01:00:39.051
I think,

746
01:00:39.844 --> 01:00:42.971
that says "ex inferis."

747
01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:46.141
"Save yourself,

748
01:00:48.561 --> 01:00:49.895
"from hell."

749
01:00:51.522 --> 01:00:54.900
Look, if what Dr. Weir tells us is true,

750
01:00:56.402 --> 01:01:00.238
this ship has been beyond
the boundaries of our universe

751
01:01:00.365 --> 01:01:02.574
of known scientific reality.

752
01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:06.244
Who knows where it's been,

753
01:01:06.704 --> 01:01:08.413
what it's seen,

754
01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:12.918
and what it's brought back with it.

755
01:01:13.252 --> 01:01:14.628
From hell.

756
01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:22.094
You don't believe in that
kind of stuff, do you?

757
01:01:24.847 --> 01:01:28.308
Whoever sent that message,
he sure believes in hell.

758
01:01:29.268 --> 01:01:30.852
Captain Miller.

759
01:01:35.024 --> 01:01:37.067
Whatever it is, Coop,
it better be good.

760
01:01:37.151 --> 01:01:38.235
Yes, sir.

761
01:01:38.319 --> 01:01:41.071
Ready to repressurize the Clark
and get the hell out of here.

762
01:01:41.155 --> 01:01:42.572
On my way.

763
01:01:47.328 --> 01:01:49.454
Come on, baby, don't let me down.

764
01:01:57.255 --> 01:02:00.215
Hello, baby. Papa's home.

765
01:02:00.842 --> 01:02:02.384
She's holding.

766
01:02:03.636 --> 01:02:04.845
Oh, shit.

767
01:02:04.929 --> 01:02:07.848
Skipper, we're still venting
trace gasses.

768
01:02:07.932 --> 01:02:10.016
Give me about 20 minutes
to plug the hole.

769
01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:14.855
Cooper, you are the lifesaver.
20 minutes and we're underway.

770
01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:19.735
Shit.

771
01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:26.783
- Got any coffee?
- Yeah, but it's cold.

772
01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:28.118
Great.

773
01:02:38.463 --> 01:02:39.671
Starck.

774
01:02:45.219 --> 01:02:46.261
Miller?

775
01:03:07.241 --> 01:03:08.533
We're leaving.

776
01:03:11.579 --> 01:03:13.455
No, we can't leave.

777
01:03:14.832 --> 01:03:16.541
Our orders are specific.

778
01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:19.503
Rescue the crew,
salvage what's left of the ship.

779
01:03:19.587 --> 01:03:22.547
The crew is dead, Doctor.
Your ship killed them.

780
01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:25.842
- We came here to do a job.
- We're aborting, Doctor!

781
01:03:26.552 --> 01:03:29.805
Starck, download the files
from the Event Horizon's computers.

782
01:03:29.889 --> 01:03:32.098
D.J., I want you to get Justin prepped

783
01:03:32.183 --> 01:03:33.675
and ready to move him back
to the Clark.

784
01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.019
There's stuff I wanna get from medical.
We'd better move him in the tank.

785
01:03:36.103 --> 01:03:37.771
No problem. Do it.

786
01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:40.899
- Peters.
- Yes, sir.

787
01:03:40.983 --> 01:03:43.025
I want you to get the CO2
scrubbers back into the Clark.

788
01:03:43.030 --> 01:03:45.320
- Take Smitty with you.
- Right.

789
01:03:45.404 --> 01:03:46.250
Captain.

790
01:03:48.251 --> 01:03:49.300
Captain.

791
01:03:51.994 --> 01:03:55.288
- Don't do this.
- It's done.

792
01:03:56.916 --> 01:03:58.959
What about my ship?
You can't just leave her.

793
01:03:59.043 --> 01:04:00.710
I have no intention of
leaving her, Doctor.

794
01:04:00.795 --> 01:04:02.865
I will take the Lewis and Clark
to a safe distance,

795
01:04:02.866 --> 01:04:05.123
and then I will launch tac missiles
at the Event Horizon,

796
01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:09.094
until I'm satisfied she's vaporized.
Fuck this ship.

797
01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:20.230
Captain Miller, the bio-scan
just went off the scale.

798
01:04:20.314 --> 01:04:21.475
It looks like the core

799
01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:24.192
is draining power
from the rest of the ship.

800
01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:27.153
Get the files. Vacate.
I want off this ship.

801
01:04:27.238 --> 01:04:30.699
You can't leave.
She won't let you.

802
01:04:30.783 --> 01:04:33.350
You just get your gear and get back
on the Lewis and Clark Doctor,

803
01:04:33.355 --> 01:04:35.579
or you'll find yourself walking home.

804
01:04:35.663 --> 01:04:37.539
I am home.

805
01:04:38.207 --> 01:04:39.457
Let's go!

806
01:04:40.001 --> 01:04:41.209
Ready?

807
01:04:42.169 --> 01:04:43.753
Shot.

808
01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:46.172
Come on.

809
01:04:47.258 --> 01:04:48.800
- Ready?
- Shot.

810
01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:55.682
- Shot.
- Okay.

811
01:04:56.183 --> 01:04:58.393
Peters, can we go?
This place is really freaking me out.

812
01:04:58.477 --> 01:05:00.103
Yeah, you wanna breathe
on the way home.

813
01:05:00.187 --> 01:05:02.397
- No, I don't! Let's go!
- Shit!

814
01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:04.316
- 25.
- Come on!

815
01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.401
- We need 25.
- Peters!

816
01:05:06.485 --> 01:05:08.612
Come on! Got it!

817
01:07:33.424 --> 01:07:35.341
Oh, no. Peters.

818
01:07:41.432 --> 01:07:43.058
Oh, God.

819
01:07:48.981 --> 01:07:50.023
Billy.

820
01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:01.409
Claire?

821
01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:09.959
Claire.

822
01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:13.296
It's me. I'm home.

823
01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.342
I'm home.

824
01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:24.265
I know I wasn't there
when you needed me,

825
01:08:25.309 --> 01:08:27.185
and I'm sorry I...

826
01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:31.064
I let my work come between us.

827
01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:37.278
God, Claire, no.

828
01:08:38.114 --> 01:08:41.783
I'm begging you, please.
Please, don't.

829
01:08:41.867 --> 01:08:43.868
Not again, please.

830
01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:47.200
I've been so...

831
01:08:51.201 --> 01:08:53.550
I've been so...

832
01:08:55.422 --> 01:08:57.423
Billy.

833
01:08:58.092 --> 01:08:59.759
It's all right.

834
01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:06.307
- I've been so alone.
- You'll never be alone again.

835
01:09:07.768 --> 01:09:11.479
You're with me now.
You're with me

836
01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:16.359
and I have such wonderful,
wonderful things

837
01:09:17.528 --> 01:09:18.987
to show you.

838
01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.883
Damn, I'm good.

839
01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:45.930
Coop. Coop, how long
are you going to take?

840
01:09:46.098 --> 01:09:47.640
'Cause I've got to get
the hell out of here.

841
01:09:47.725 --> 01:09:50.393
Look, you can kiss my ass, Smith,
'cause I'm done.

842
01:09:50.477 --> 01:09:52.729
Just give me a second
to collect my tools

843
01:09:52.730 --> 01:09:54.147
and we can get out of Dodge.

844
01:09:54.231 --> 01:09:56.399
- Two minutes tops.
- Roger that.

845
01:10:02.489 --> 01:10:03.531
Weir.

846
01:10:04.074 --> 01:10:05.408
Dr. Weir.

847
01:10:05.993 --> 01:10:07.281
Weir!

848
01:10:10.566 --> 01:10:11.650
Weir!

849
01:10:13.667 --> 01:10:15.752
Dr. Weir,
get your ass back on board now!

850
01:10:15.836 --> 01:10:17.462
Weir!

851
01:10:18.339 --> 01:10:19.631
Shit.

852
01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:22.467
Captain Miller,
Captain Miller, do you copy? Over.

853
01:10:22.843 --> 01:10:25.261
Captain Miller.
Captain Miller, do you copy? Over.

854
01:10:25.346 --> 01:10:26.471
Go ahead, Smitty.

855
01:10:26.555 --> 01:10:29.515
I've just seen Weir
messing around on the Clark sir.

856
01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:34.229
Stand by, Smitty,
I wanna check something out.

857
01:10:39.818 --> 01:10:42.237
- Smith, get out of there.
- Come again, sir?

858
01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:44.239
One of the explosives is missing
from the corridor.

859
01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.741
- Weir might have put it on the Clark.
- No. No way.

860
01:10:46.825 --> 01:10:49.452
No, sir, no way.
I've just put it back together, sir.

861
01:10:49.536 --> 01:10:51.871
Get off the Clark now, Smith!

862
01:11:01.006 --> 01:11:03.049
Where the fucking hell are you?

863
01:11:25.531 --> 01:11:27.198
Got you.

864
01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:29.242
Hang on, Smitty. I'm coming!

865
01:11:43.215 --> 01:11:44.257
No!

866
01:12:35.309 --> 01:12:36.809
Shit!

867
01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:38.186
Where the fuck am I going?

868
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:41.272
Why does this shit got to
happen to me? Fuck.

869
01:12:43.275 --> 01:12:45.568
All right, think, Coop. Think. Think.

870
01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:49.739
All right, I got to get back to the ship.
I got to get back to the ship, all right.

871
01:12:49.823 --> 01:12:53.368
I gotta blow my air tank.
I'll blow my air tank.

872
01:12:55.162 --> 01:12:56.204
All right. Fuck.

873
01:12:56.288 --> 01:12:59.457
This better work. This shit
better work. All right.

874
01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:03.369
Here I go. All right.
One, two, three. Come on.

875
01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:07.298
Come on. Come on. Yes! Yes! Yes!

876
01:13:08.634 --> 01:13:11.219
Here I come, motherfuckers!

877
01:13:18.018 --> 01:13:19.185
D.J.

878
01:13:20.396 --> 01:13:22.522
- What was that?
- Clark's gone.

879
01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:26.359
- Smitty and Cooper are dead.
- What? What the...

880
01:13:26.485 --> 01:13:29.487
It was Weir.
You spot him, you take him out.

881
01:13:29.822 --> 01:13:31.239
Understood.

882
01:13:31.824 --> 01:13:34.826
- Be careful, D.J.
- Don't worry about Weir.

883
01:13:35.828 --> 01:13:37.703
I'll take care of him.

884
01:13:47.673 --> 01:13:48.881
D.J.?

885
01:14:01.186 --> 01:14:04.772
D.J.? D.J., answer me!

886
01:14:52.613 --> 01:14:54.739
Okay, Dr. Weir.

887
01:14:59.119 --> 01:15:01.579
You don't wanna leave your ship?

888
01:15:02.456 --> 01:15:04.081
You never will.

889
01:16:03.141 --> 01:16:04.183
Starck.

890
01:16:26.665 --> 01:16:28.040
It's okay.

891
01:16:32.212 --> 01:16:34.338
I'm gonna get you out of here.

892
01:16:37.342 --> 01:16:38.551
Okay.

893
01:16:42.889 --> 01:16:44.223
Easy.

894
01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:01.782
Oh, my God.

895
01:17:03.577 --> 01:17:05.536
What happened to your eyes?

896
01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:09.457
Where we're going,
we won't need eyes to see.

897
01:17:09.541 --> 01:17:11.459
What are you talking about?

898
01:17:11.543 --> 01:17:15.463
I created the Event Horizon
to reach the stars.

899
01:17:16.256 --> 01:17:19.550
But she's gone much,
much further than that.

900
01:17:20.927 --> 01:17:23.387
She tore a hole in our universe,

901
01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:27.058
a gateway to another dimension.

902
01:17:27.726 --> 01:17:30.102
A dimension of pure chaos,

903
01:17:30.937 --> 01:17:33.397
pure evil.

904
01:17:33.899 --> 01:17:37.360
When she crossed over,
she was just a ship.

905
01:17:37.444 --> 01:17:39.570
But when she came back,

906
01:17:40.572 --> 01:17:43.074
she was alive.

907
01:17:44.284 --> 01:17:46.118
Look at her, Miller.

908
01:17:47.412 --> 01:17:50.456
Isn't she beautiful?

909
01:17:50.582 --> 01:17:54.919
Your beautiful ship
killed its crew, Doctor.

910
01:17:55.796 --> 01:17:57.254
Well,

911
01:17:58.799 --> 01:18:01.133
now she has another crew.

912
01:18:02.969 --> 01:18:05.304
Now she has us.

913
01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:15.022
What do you think you're doing,
Doctor?

914
01:18:15.107 --> 01:18:18.275
You wanted to know
where the ship has been,

915
01:18:18.777 --> 01:18:20.986
so now you'll find out.

916
01:18:34.793 --> 01:18:36.313
If you miss me,
you blow out the hull.

917
01:18:37.014 --> 01:18:38.850
What makes you think
I'll miss?

918
01:18:40.882 --> 01:18:42.508
That's right, I'm back!

919
01:18:42.634 --> 01:18:45.386
I'm... Shit, I can't stop. Hey!

920
01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:47.471
Hey! Fuck.

921
01:18:49.349 --> 01:18:52.351
What? Who the fuck? Oh, shit!

922
01:20:27.364 --> 01:20:30.407
Miller! Miller!

923
01:20:43.129 --> 01:20:44.922
Give me your hand!

924
01:20:53.932 --> 01:20:56.267
- Come on!
- I can't!

925
01:20:58.103 --> 01:20:59.937
I'm not leaving you.

926
01:21:19.958 --> 01:21:21.625
Forward airlock.

927
01:21:27.090 --> 01:21:28.591
It can't be Weir.

928
01:21:29.593 --> 01:21:31.802
I'm not taking any chances.

929
01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:34.305
You watch your back.

930
01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:47.276
- Yo! Don't hit me.
- Cooper!

931
01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:50.154
Take it off! Take it off!

932
01:21:51.323 --> 01:21:53.240
- I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
- You're okay.

933
01:21:53.325 --> 01:21:56.994
- You're okay. It's over.
- No, it's not.

934
01:21:57.621 --> 01:22:00.372
Weir's activated the gravity drive.
We got to shut it down.

935
01:22:00.457 --> 01:22:02.458
- How? The bridge is gone.
- What about Engineering?

936
01:22:02.542 --> 01:22:03.792
You think you can shut it
down from there?

937
01:22:03.877 --> 01:22:06.378
I don't know the process.
Dr. Weir was the expert.

938
01:22:06.463 --> 01:22:08.000
I don't want to go where
the other crew went, okay?

939
01:22:08.006 --> 01:22:09.798
- I'd rather be dead.
- Okay.

940
01:22:09.883 --> 01:22:12.259
- Okay, we blow the fucker up.
- We blow it up?

941
01:22:12.344 --> 01:22:15.512
Do like Weir said.
Blow the corridor,

942
01:22:16.306 --> 01:22:20.267
separate us from the rest of ship.
Use the foredecks as a lifeboat.

943
01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:22.937
With any luck, TDRS will pick up
our emergency beacon.

944
01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:25.314
We prep the gravity couches,
put ourselves in stasis,

945
01:22:25.398 --> 01:22:27.149
and stand by for
a search and rescue team.

946
01:22:27.233 --> 01:22:29.610
Meantime, I'm gonna go
manually arm these explosives.

947
01:22:29.694 --> 01:22:31.704
- Skipper, will this shit work?
- It worked for Dr. Weir.

948
01:22:31.710 --> 01:22:34.281
You go activate the emergency beacon.
You get back here double-quick.

949
01:22:34.366 --> 01:22:35.958
- Yes, sir.
- I'll come with you.

950
01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:38.327
You stay here.
You prep the gravity couches.

951
01:22:38.411 --> 01:22:39.495
Miller.

952
01:22:41.706 --> 01:22:44.041
Close this door behind me,
Lieutenant.

953
01:22:53.843 --> 01:22:57.888
<i>Gateway opening in T minus
five minutes.</i>

954
01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:06.689
<i>Emergency beacon activated.</i>

955
01:23:08.566 --> 01:23:10.401
Yes.

956
01:23:10.568 --> 01:23:11.902
Blood?

957
01:23:19.244 --> 01:23:21.078
Oh, fuck me.

958
01:23:21.746 --> 01:23:23.247
Fuck me.

959
01:23:24.207 --> 01:23:25.298
Starck!

960
01:23:48.999 --> 01:23:50.099
Starck!

961
01:23:54.279 --> 01:23:55.654
Run!

962
01:23:58.324 --> 01:24:02.745
<i>Gateway opening in T minus
three minutes.</i>

963
01:24:06.624 --> 01:24:09.793
<i>Detonator release is authorized.</i>

964
01:24:10.587 --> 01:24:13.464
<i>The main corridor is now armed.</i>

965
01:24:13.631 --> 01:24:15.758
We're armed. She's ready to blow.

966
01:24:16.092 --> 01:24:19.094
I repeat, we are armed.
She's ready to blow.

967
01:24:19.512 --> 01:24:21.930
Miller. Miller, can you hear me?

968
01:24:22.015 --> 01:24:24.099
We have to get out of here now.

969
01:24:26.644 --> 01:24:28.353
You let me burn.

970
01:24:45.997 --> 01:24:50.667
<i>Gateway opening in T minus
two minutes.</i>

971
01:25:06.976 --> 01:25:08.018
Miller.

972
01:25:27.705 --> 01:25:29.665
You left me behind.

973
01:25:32.043 --> 01:25:35.087
No, you're not Edmund Corrick.
I watched him die.

974
01:25:39.509 --> 01:25:41.009
Weir?

975
01:25:43.555 --> 01:25:47.474
The ship brought me back.
I told you she won't let me leave.

976
01:25:47.559 --> 01:25:49.768
She won't let anyone leave.

977
01:25:49.894 --> 01:25:52.688
Did you really think
you could destroy this ship?

978
01:25:53.022 --> 01:25:56.066
She's defied space and time.

979
01:25:56.609 --> 01:26:00.112
She's been to a place
you couldn't possibly imagine.

980
01:26:00.238 --> 01:26:01.947
And now.

981
01:26:02.407 --> 01:26:06.660
- It is time to go back.
- I know, to hell.

982
01:26:06.744 --> 01:26:10.122
You know nothing.
Hell is only a word.

983
01:26:10.582 --> 01:26:14.918
The reality is much, much worse.

984
01:26:17.589 --> 01:26:20.591
Now let me show you.

985
01:26:21.968 --> 01:26:23.260
Help me!

986
01:26:26.598 --> 01:26:28.432
No!

987
01:26:30.476 --> 01:26:32.186
No.

988
01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:34.021
- You see?
- No.

989
01:26:34.105 --> 01:26:37.816
They're not dead.
They're not dead.

990
01:26:37.942 --> 01:26:39.318
Not yet.

991
01:26:41.112 --> 01:26:46.271
You... won't... take... my... crew.

992
01:27:06.012 --> 01:27:09.848
They're not your crew anymore.
They belong to the ship.

993
01:27:09.974 --> 01:27:11.433
<i>Gateway opening.</i>

994
01:27:26.491 --> 01:27:27.824
Take me.

995
01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:30.535
You take me.
You leave them alone.

996
01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:34.164
No. There is no escape.

997
01:27:36.292 --> 01:27:38.126
The gateway is open,

998
01:27:38.211 --> 01:27:41.171
and you are all coming with me.

999
01:27:45.843 --> 01:27:47.187
Do you see?

1000
01:27:51.856 --> 01:27:53.456
Do you see?

1001
01:27:55.556 --> 01:27:57.056
Do you see?

1002
01:27:59.857 --> 01:28:01.191
Yes.

1003
01:28:02.568 --> 01:28:04.361
I see.

1004
01:28:07.699 --> 01:28:09.408
No!

1005
01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:31.239
Miller.

1006
01:29:38.706 --> 01:29:41.625
This is Rescue One.
We have contact.

1007
01:29:43.252 --> 01:29:46.630
Approaching the wreckage
of the Event Horizon.

1008
01:29:46.714 --> 01:29:48.298
Prepare to board.

1009
01:29:57.892 --> 01:30:00.268
I'm entering the grav couch bay.

1010
01:30:00.937 --> 01:30:04.940
It doesn't appear to have been
damaged in the explosion.

1011
01:30:06.484 --> 01:30:08.652
There appear to be three survivors:

1012
01:30:09.112 --> 01:30:12.406
Cooper, Justin, Lieutenant Starck.

1013
01:30:13.157 --> 01:30:16.076
Justin seems to have suffered
massive injuries

1014
01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:17.911
but he's still alive.

1015
01:30:19.831 --> 01:30:22.332
The grav couches still have power.

1016
01:30:24.919 --> 01:30:27.170
I'm opening the first tank now.

1017
01:30:37.306 --> 01:30:39.433
It's all right. It's okay.

1018
01:30:39.517 --> 01:30:41.435
- You're safe now.
- Justin, Cooper.

1019
01:30:41.519 --> 01:30:43.854
They're fine. They're with us.

1020
01:30:45.356 --> 01:30:47.023
They're with us.

1021
01:30:49.694 --> 01:30:52.946
- Starck. Starck.
- Stay calm. It's all right.

1022
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:54.948
- Calm down, it's me.
- Breathe deeply.

1023
01:30:55.032 --> 01:30:56.000
- Starck.
- Breathe deeply.

1024
01:30:56.025 --> 01:30:58.452
- It's the rescue team.
- I need a sedative here, now!

1025
01:30:58.536 --> 01:31:01.455
- I got you, Starck. I got you.
- It's okay.

1026
01:31:01.831 --> 01:31:03.290
I need a sedative here, now!

1027
01:31:03.374 --> 01:31:05.375
Starck, it's the rescue team.
We're safe.

1028
01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:08.211
- Okay, okay, I need it now!
- We're safe.
